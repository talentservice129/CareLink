We have ongoing HTML change needs.
Here are some simple ones to get started.  Do well with these and there will be many more:

a) Can we have an image here, that when clicked, plays a video in the same location?

b) Make icons the same size, and align them to the top of the shield:

c) Make these icons appear without white div blocks (the icons ARE transparent):

d) Change this section to be a single circle picture (Use any placeholder) and a box in the middle.  Needs to keep that background, just remove other people faces

e) Move this 3rd purple sentence up:

f) Video needs to go UNDER the "Schedule a Demo" button on smaller devices:

g) Put these two text items next to the icon.  You can make the icon a little larger if needed:
